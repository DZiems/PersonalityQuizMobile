        Your first memories are within the vast Droob'n oasis where you were born, and you have so far seen a prosperous life full of wonder and inquisitiveness while surrounded by the sweeping sands.

        You are a chitin-armored quadruped with deeply powerful analytical and philosophical prowess. In fact, you belong to the species which most recognize to have the most extreme raw intelligence. Your wisdom will shine through many of your life's challenges, and so you find yourself most fulfilled by the deep advancements to knowledge you make along the way.

        Though you may be the exception, tenacity is not the average Droob'n'st person's strong-suit, and as well, you may struggle with teamwork. You are, however, especially precise in words and actions, and your good intentions around others do not go unnoticed.

        Now, what knowledge do you seek to uncover, where will it take you, and how will you forever etch your discoveries into history? Only you know. Welcome to the Droob'n'st civilization.

        """
        Your first memories come from your beautiful underground home, set within a complex, technically advanced web of intriguing structural design--the typical introduction for a Skloon'st person.

        You are a mole-humanoid with a strong capacity to adapt and an especially remarkable affinity for creation. Maybe you are artistic, maybe you build for functionality--no matter your various fixations, you epitomize artisanship.

        Though you work well with others, you also strongly value your alone time, and thus you may unintentionally throw people off. However, your distinguishing Skloon'st characteristics of both resilience and decisiveness shine brightly as you push headstrong through life's adversities, always willing to adapt and grow in the process.

        Where will your drive and inventiveness take you, and what will be your next brilliant creation? Only you know. Welcome to the Skloon'st civilization.

        Your first memory is of the warm, soothing hum you heard while encircled by your Garoof'ibn'st brothers and sisters--a long-held tradition to introduce any Garoof'ibn'st person's first year of life. Since your earliest memory, you have resided on the biggest of seven islands in the Garoof'ibn archipelago, though you and your people consider every island equally your home.

        You are a shapeshifting, florfnerb-weaving, psychic empath with a unique and powerful expressiveness in you. Though you are well-rounded, your sensory abilities most define your character.

        You are finely tuned to other people, are connected deeply to your spirit, and as you are so talented at expressing, are likely artistically inclined, too. Your people are natural symbiotes with the deadly florfnerb plant, and from it you have gained world-renowned psychic abilities.

        Will your willpower be the first to master the coveted art of telekinesis? Only you know. Welcome to the Garoof'ibn'st civilization.

        Your first memory is by a crackling campfire, celebrating the prime social event of your people, when, at a very young age, you first felt your ability to harness the immense heat a H'glur'boon'st generates from within. You live in the tall H'glur'boon mountains--fitting for a tall, celestial rock giant like yourself. Though the history your people's origins are undocumented, always have your people spoken of crashing down to the land from the stars above.

        Your people maintain a deep and meaningful relationship with nearly all lifeforms whose presence they have graced. Your ability to connect with others is one of your greatest strengths.

        Though you may be the exception, a H'glur'boon'st person generally lacks great analytical intelligence, and due to their default selflessness, at times they may be exploited. However, your deep values of wisdom and compassion, both of which coincide well with your physical and mental robustness, are essential for making you who you are and your life as meaningful as it is.

        With your power to generate and focus heat so vigorously--but also your sensitive heart--where will you go, what will you explore, and whose life will you touch? Only you know. Welcome to the H'glur'boon'st civilization.

        Your first memory reminds you of chaotic time for your people, but still, it is a fond one. The Fn'r'noot region was just days away from being struck by the Püt wave--the planet's most devastating storm to date--and you and your people had to work extremely hard to prepare. But, you are a Fn'r'noot'st seal-person. Your clever, hard-working, and strategic mind didn't stop you, even at a young age, from working alongside your people to guarantee prosperity.

        The final night, your people held a gathering and a feast beneath the well-protected shelters you all had strived to secure. At one point, the leader of your people, Foopl'drok, came up to acknlowedge your efforts, especially given your young age. You remember responding with a funny joke--so funny it sent Great Foopl'drok howling with laughter. He thanked you even more sincerely, and you felt suddenly more fulfilled than all the work you had done could have made you.

        Since the Püt catastrophe, life has been confusing. Your people are divided, and you side with the West. As you recognized in your funny remark with Fookl'drok, your skills and values are best put toward finding happiness, not power. Still--though you may be the exception--Fn'r'noot'st people often overwork and appear impersonal, as a deep cultural paradigm maintains that success comes to those who push hardest for it.

        Given the split between your people, and consequently your own identity at times, you are left wondering what experiences you will have, how you will change, and what changes you will make. You must find out. Welcome to the Western Fn'r'noot'st civilization.

You remember thanking him back for the opportunity, and then standing strong, you met eyes with him. He told you he saw ferocity in those eyes, and with a subtle stammer he must have practiced controlling, to be careful controlling the power you would make for yourself.

        Since the Püt catastrophe, life has stayed interesting. Your people are divided, and you side with the East. As you realized in your exchange with Fookl'drok, you were born with the skills and opportunities for great power if you lend yourself to them. This meshes well with the mindset of the East. Even still, you are often frustrated by those around you with slower or less disciplined minds, meaning that sometimes maintaining friendships is not your strong-suit.

        Given the split between your people, but your deep awareness in your own potential, you are left wondering what experiences you will have, how you will grow, and what changes you will make. You must find out. Welcome to the Eastern Fn'r'noot'st civilization.
